				<p><img src="images/restaurant1.jpg" class="aboutimg aboutleft">Beef is and continues to be a favorite meal of the American family.  JB’s Steakhouse is dedicated to one thing: serving the best beef you will ever eat.  They start by using only the highest quality U.S.D.A. Choice beef.  Each and every day, JB’s Steakhouse hand cuts their steaks and age them to culinary perfection.  They hand season all of their beef with JB’s Steakhouse’s own butcher block seasoning giving their beef a rich, unique taste.  To ensure a perfect steak, JB’s Steakhouse cooks their steaks over an open flame just as they did in the old west.</p>  

				<p>JB’s Steakhouse’s attention to detail is why they guarantee their steaks are the best steaks your will ever eat.  Thousands of patrons have enjoyed JB’s Steakhouse steaks including a number of notable dignitaries.  JB’s Steakhouse has served their beef to President George Bush and First Lady Laura Bush; Heisman Trophy winner and professional football running back, Barry Sanders; national championship and hall of fame college football coach and United States Congressman, Tom Osborne; the staff and crew of the NBC’s television show Unsolved Mysteries, two-time Emmy award winning and Silver Circle award winning meteorologist, Gary England; Patrick Wayne, son of legendary actor, John Wayne; Six time Grammy award winner, Ronnie Milsap; Grammy award winning and top vocal group of 1978, Oakridge Boys; and several members of the professional football team Dallas Cowboys, including Robert Newhouse, Tony Hill, Ed “Too Tall” Jones, Harvey Martin and Ron Fellows.</p><img src="images/restaurant2.jpg" class="aboutimg aboutright">

				<p>When it comes to great quality beef, JB’s Steakhouse is dripping with a rich heritage.  Established in 1978 by J.B. Nichols, JB’s Steakhouse is a historic landmark of the old Indian Territory.  An icon of Woodward and Northwest Oklahoma, JB’s Steakhouse commemorates the American cowboy, cattle drives and years of the past.  Although the Riffel Family purchased JB’s Steakhouse in April 1991, it has remained in its long-time location along the old historic Great Western cattle trail and Butterfield stagecoach route.  JB’s Steakhouse hosts an annual cattle drive at the end of July each year and continues to be a favorite stop for weary travelers.</p>

				<p>JB’s Steakhouse is still located on several lots in the Helen Lee Subdivision of Woodward, Oklahoma.  In 1906, Helen Lee retained attorney Temple Houston, infamous son of Sam Houston, to subdivide and develop her 135 acres at the time Woodward was founded.  The original survey pins along with a hitching post from the late 1800s can still be found on the premises.  JB’s Steakhouse is a unique reminder of the great, wild west.</p>
